       "0  there is a beach clean up and i can get more details i can see opened messages and community events sign up it is cool because this feels like a fun and better informed way of finding events but still ensures safety measures because you actually have to sign up it feels legitimate and only actual users post here i think to make it more safe the community board events should be generated only by users that are verified or already existing organizations or someone with a title or experience maybe for some posts on the board they can be visible to public friends or close friends   \n",
